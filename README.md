# SNneutrinos-sim

Simulation tool for the estimation of the detection efficiency in LEGEND-1000 water tank of the positrons from the IBD of SuperNova neutrinos.
L1000-alternative:
additional PMTs on the dead water volume between the PMT wall and the water tank wall. The surfaces are covered by reflective foil.
